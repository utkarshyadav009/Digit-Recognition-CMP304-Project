# Digit-Recognition-CMP304-Preoject

Hand written digit recognition using feed forward neural network and softmax actiavtion function, It is a shallow neural network with no hidden layers 
used SFML library for GUI 
the number 6 and 9 do not get recogenised properly in this version, maybe due to the limited training data provided 



A handwritten digit recognizer using a shallow neural network i.e., no hidden layers was built for this project. The network uses the MNIST dataset (insert citation) which is divided into chunks to
