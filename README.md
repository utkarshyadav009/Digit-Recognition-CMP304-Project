# Digit-Recognition-CMP304-Preoject

Hand written digit recognition using feed forward neural network and softmax actiavtion function, It is a shallow neural network with no hidden layers 
used SFML library for GUI 
the number 6 and 9 do not get recogenised properly in this version, maybe due to the limited training data provided 

A report document is added to the project with explanation of how the neural network functions and what formuila's it uses.
